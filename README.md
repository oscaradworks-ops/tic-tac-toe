# Lab: Build a Small JavaScript Application

## 🎯 Goal

Build a small interactive JavaScript application. Practice breaking down a large problem into smaller parts, prompting Copilot effectively, reviewing its suggestions, and ensuring you understand the code before using it.

---

## 🕹️ Projects ...

You may build **any one** of the following applications:

### **1. Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

A simple 3×3 interactive grid where two players take turns placing X and O.

### **2. Image Gallery**

A grid of images that expands, highlights, or shows captions/details when clicked.

### **3. Interactive Web Form**

A form with validation, dynamic fields, success messages, and helpful UI behavior.

### **4. Snake Game**

A simple version of Snake played inside a canvas, where the snake grows as it eats.

You will follow the **same step-by-step process** regardless of the project you choose.

## ✅ STEP 1 — Create a Basic HTML Page


"Create a simple HTML page with a centered title and an empty container where my application will be displayed."


---

## ✅ STEP 2 — Add Basic Layout/CSS


"Write CSS to create the basic layout of my application. Make the container centered and clean-looking."

✔ For Tic-Tac-Toe: grid layout
✔ For Gallery: image grid
✔ For Form: spacing, labels, alignment
✔ For Snake: centered canvas

---

## ✅ STEP 3 — Add Interactive Elements

"Write JavaScript that makes the main elements of my app interactive, and log interactions to the console."

* Tic-Tac-Toe → Clicking cells
* Gallery → Clicking thumbnails
* Form → Logging input events
* Snake → Logging key presses

---

## ✅ STEP 4 — Add Core Functionality

"Add the main behavior of the application based on user interactions."


* Tic-Tac-Toe → X/O turns
* Gallery → Expand image or show details
* Form → Validate fields
* Snake → Move based on arrow keys

✔ Test frequently.

---

## ✅ STEP 5 — Prevent Invalid Actions


"Improve the logic to prevent invalid or repeated actions."

Examples:

* Tic-Tac-Toe → No overwriting cells
* Gallery → No repeating animations
* Form → Prevent submitting empty fields
* Snake → Prevent reversing direction into itself

---

## ✅ STEP 6 — Add Completion Logic or Feedback


Examples:

* Tic-Tac-Toe → Win detection
* Gallery → Highlight active image
* Form → Show success message
* Snake → Detect game over

---

## ✅ STEP 7 — Add Reset/Restart Button

"Add a Reset button and write JavaScript to restart the application state."

✔ Make sure the app resets cleanly.

---

## ✅ STEP 8 — Add Polished Styling

**Prompt Copilot:**

"Make my application look modern and clean with improved colors, spacing, and small animations."

✔ Keep it simple.
